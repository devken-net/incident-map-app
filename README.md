## Incident Map App

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)
Serves `mock-api` with the help of `drakov`. And serves app using `webpackDevServer`.


## Quickstart

To get started:

```sh
npm install
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
npm run mock-api
# need to serve mock-api first
npm start
# will use webpackDevServer
```

## Disclaimer

Due to limited development time. There are some limitations for this exam:

* Able to test only in `Chrome v73`.
* Incidents `coordinates` is not accurate.
* No PWA server has been setup which means no offline support.
* No unit test.
* Did not able to code review thorougly. (I just rely on linter for now.)
* UX/UI is not perfect.
* Desktop view only.
* Not able to make `Storybook`.

## Accomplishments

* Able to plot incidents on the map.
* Able to show list of all incidents.
* Able to make document for rest api under `./mock-api/incidents.md`.
* Able to create api request. See `./src/services/incidents-api.js`.
* Able to create reusable components. See `./src/components/*`.
